# audio_classification

## dataset

### 1. source dataset
(1) drone driving audio(challenge)
    - drone noise
    - rescue request(human)
      - male / female / child ( 3 class )
      
(2) drone noise(youtube)
    - drone sounds similar to challenge drones.
    - siren sound
    
### 2. processed dataset
(1-1) only drone noise
      - drone driving audio without rescue request (using it to remove drone noise)

(1-2) only drone noise + siren
      - drone driving audio without rescue request (using it to remove drone noise)

(2) only rescue request
    - rescue request audio with drone noise (using it to classification)
    
## train

(1) audio preprocessing
(2) extract audio features
(3) stft / mfcc 
(4) neural network training
